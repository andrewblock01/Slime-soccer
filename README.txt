# Slime-soccer

This game is run by running the main method in the Game class.  The main playing
field is controlled by the GameCourt class.  This controls the animation and
some of the physics of the objects in the game.  It also controls the game
logic.  

The classes that I created are Slime and Goal.  Each of these classes
is relatively simple and is implemented similarly to the provided Circle,
Square, and Poison classes.
